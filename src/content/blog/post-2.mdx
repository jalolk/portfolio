## What are Astro, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI?

Before we dive in, let's briefly introduce these technologies:

1. **Astro**: A modern static site builder that allows you to use your favorite JavaScript framework while delivering lightning-fast performance.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps you rapidly build custom designs without leaving your HTML.
3. **DaisyUI**: A plugin for Tailwind CSS that provides a set of pre-designed components and utility classes.

## Benefits of Using This Stack

- **Speed**: Astro's partial hydration approach ensures your site loads quickly.
- **Flexibility**: Use any JavaScript framework you prefer within Astro.
- **Rapid Development**: Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI allow for quick styling and prototyping.
- **Customization**: Easily tailor your design to your specific needs.
- **SEO-friendly**: Astro generates static HTML, which is great for search engines.

## Setting Up Your Project

Let's get started with setting up your project!

### Step 1: Create an Astro Project

First, let's create a new Astro project:

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-astro-project
cd my-astro-project

# Initialize a new Astro project
npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. Choose the "Empty" template for a fresh start.

### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

Now, let's add Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to your project:

```bash
# Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies
npm install -D tailwindcss @astrojs/tailwind

# Install DaisyUI
npm install -D daisyui@latest

# Generate Tailwind config file
npx tailwindcss init
```

### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

Update your `tailwind.config.js` file to include DaisyUI:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require('daisyui')],
}
```

### Step 4: Set Up Astro Integration

Add the Tailwind integration to your Astro config. Create or update `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [tailwind()],
});
```

### Step 5: Create Your First Page

Create a new file `src/pages/index.astro` and add the following content:

```astro
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
    <title>Astro + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="hero min-h-screen bg-base-200">
      <div class="hero-content text-center">
        <div class="max-w-md">
          <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">Hello there</h1>
          <p class="py-6">Welcome to your new Astro project with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI!</p>
          <button class="btn btn-primary">Get Started</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

This example uses DaisyUI's `hero` component and some Tailwind utility classes.

### Step 6: Run Your Project

Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` in your browser to see your new Astro project with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI in action!
