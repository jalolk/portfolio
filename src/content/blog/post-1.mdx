# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
```

### Rendering the Blog Post

Astro makes it simple to render this Markdown content. Here's a basic example of how you might set up a page to display a blog post:

```astro
---
import MainLayout from '../../layouts/MainLayout.astro';
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const blogEntries = await getCollection('blog');
  return blogEntries.map(entry => ({
    params: { slug: entry.slug }, props: { entry },
  }));
}

const { entry } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await entry.render();
---

<MainLayout title={entry.data.title}>
  <article>
    <h1>{entry.data.title}</h1>
    <p>Published on: {entry.data.pubDate.toDateString()}</p>
    <Content />
  </article>
</MainLayout>
```

### The Rendered Result
