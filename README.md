## 🏗️ Why Astro and Markdown?

### Astro for Static Site Generation

We chose Astro for this portfolio website for several key reasons:

1. **Performance**: Astro generates static HTML, resulting in extremely fast load times and improved SEO.
2. **Component Islands**: Astro allows us to use interactive components only where needed, keeping the rest of the site lightweight.
3. **Framework Flexibility**: While we're primarily using TypeScript, Astro allows integration with various front-end frameworks if needed in the future.
4. **Built-in Optimizations**: Astro provides out-of-the-box optimizations for images, styles, and scripts.

### Markdown for Blog Posts

We use Markdown files for blog posts, which are fetched and processed at build time. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Content Separation**: Keeping content in Markdown files separates it from the code, making it easier to manage and update.
2. **Build-time Processing**: By processing Markdown at build time, we ensure fast page loads without the need for client-side rendering of content.
3. **Version Control**: Markdown files can be easily version-controlled, allowing us to track changes to content over time.
4. **Easy Authoring**: Markdown is a simple and widely-used format, making it easy to create and edit blog posts without needing to understand the underlying code.

This setup allows for a streamlined content creation process while maintaining the benefits of a static site, resulting in a fast, efficient, and easily maintainable portfolio website.
